# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How It Works

* **`style.css`**: This file handles the visual design of the game. It sets the background color, styles the game container, and defines the appearance of the individual game boxes. It also includes styles for the reset and new game buttons.
* **`app.js`**: This file contains the game's core logic. It keeps track of whose turn it is ("O" starts first) and defines the winning combinations. It checks for a winner after each move and can disable the game boxes once a winner is found. You can also reset or start a new game using the buttons, which are controlled by this file.

## How to Play

1.  Place all the files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js`) in the same folder.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3.  Click on any of the empty boxes to make your move. "O" goes first, followed by "X".
4.  The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5.  Click the **"Reset Game"** button to clear the board and start over, or click **"New Game"** after a winner is announced to play again.
